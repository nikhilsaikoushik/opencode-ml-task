Task 1: Distance-Based Classification from Scratch

1. Objective
The objective of this task is to implement a distance-based classification algorithm
from scratch to understand how similarity between data points is used for prediction.
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was implemented without using any machine
learning libraries.

2. Dataset
The Fashion-MNIST dataset was used.
It contains grayscale images of clothing items belonging to 10 different classes.
Each image is of size 28×28 pixels.

For computational efficiency, a subset of the dataset was used:
- Training samples: 5000
- Test samples: 500

Each image was flattened into a 784-dimensional numerical feature vector and
normalized to the range [0, 1].

3. Algorithm Description
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a lazy learning and non-parametric algorithm.
There is no explicit training phase.
For each test sample, distances to all training samples are computed and the
K closest samples are selected.
The predicted class is determined using majority voting.

4. Distance Metrics Used
Two distance metrics were implemented and compared:

a) Euclidean Distance:
This metric measures the straight-line distance between two feature vectors.
It is suitable for continuous numerical data such as image pixel values.

b) Manhattan Distance:
This metric measures distance as the sum of absolute differences between feature
values. It can be more robust to small variations in pixel intensity.

5. Evaluation Method
Model performance was evaluated using classification accuracy:

Accuracy = (Number of Correct Predictions) / (Total Test Samples)

Misclassified samples were stored for further analysis.

6. Effect of K
The algorithm was tested with different values of K (K = 1, 3, 5).

- Smaller K values are sensitive to noise and can lead to overfitting.
- Larger K values provide smoother decision boundaries but may underfit.

The best K value was selected based on accuracy for each distance metric.

7. Misclassification Analysis
Misclassifications mainly occurred between visually similar classes such as:
- T-shirt vs Shirt
- Sneaker vs Sandal
- Coat vs Pullover

These errors occur due to overlapping visual features in pixel-based representations.

8. Conclusion
KNN was successfully implemented from scratch using both Euclidean and Manhattan
distance metrics and evaluated on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
The experiment demonstrated how distance-based classification works and how the
choice of K and distance metric affects model performance.
